## Description

If a user is redirected or forwarded to a page defined by an unverified entry, the target URL can be manipulated by an attacker.
 This attack is used to redirect a user to a malicious website through a website with a trusted domain name (phishing) or to access an unauthorized internal page.

## Examples

My bank provides a very interesting page ‚ÄúMy favorites‚Äù to easily access all available services and manage my own favorites. Thanks to this page, I can retrieve all my favourites from any computer, everywhere in the world.
 For example, when I want to consult my emails, I click on ‚ÄúMy mailbox‚Äù I have added in that page. The URL `https://www.mybank.com/redirect.jsp?url=www.mymailbox.com` is called then I am redirected to `http://www.mymailbox.com/`.

Last time I‚Äôve checked my mailbox, I have received an email from my bank to confirm my login and passcode for security reasons. I click on the provided link, enter my login and passcode and that‚Äôs it!
 The problem is the link I have clicked on was `https://www.mybank.com/redirect.jsp?url=www.trustme.com` and I was silently redirected to `http://www.trustme.com/` on a page with the look-and-feel of my bank‚Äôs website.
 A few days later, I received a call from my bank. Someone has used my personal credentials to access my accounts and sent my money abroad.

## Mitigations

It is very simple to mitigate this risk: never redirect or forward to unverified URLs or URLs modifiable with user entry.

An unverified URL is an URL entered by the user and not verified/trusted by the server.
 A modifiable URL is a URL with parts (domain name, path, parameters‚Ä¶) that can be modified with unverified/untrusted values entered by user.
 In both cases, the URL can be a full URL (for redirections) or a path to an internal resource (for forwards).

If you really need to redirect a user to another page (external or internal) registered by that user, the page URL must not be in a request parameter. Use an indirect reference instead. Refer to one of my previous posts about [Insecure Direct Object References](https://blog.ippon.tech/owasp-top-10-a4/ "OWASP Top 10 - A4 Insecure Direct Object References") for details on generating an indirect object reference.
 E.g. use `https://www.mybank.com/redirect.jsp?urlId=abc321` instead of `https://www.mybank.com/redirect.jsp?url=www.mymailbox.com`, where `urlId` is an indirect reference to the URL `http://www.mymailbox.com` added in user‚Äôs favorites.
 Besides, you can also check the URL is well-formed and can be trusted before storing it in your database. Some commercial antivirus/firewall products and online services provide blacklist of suspicious websites that can‚Äôt be trusted.

If the user can choose a landing page after some actions (e.g. its default homepage after login), instead of giving him a blank field to enter what he wants, propose a list of acceptable landing pages. This way, the user won‚Äôt be tempted to enter something like `/secure/mgmt/users.xhtml` to access user management without authorization! Obviously, if you have applied what I have said in my post about [Missing Function Level Access Control](https://blog.ippon.tech/owasp-top-10-a7/ "OWASP Top 10 - A7 Missing Function Level Access Control"), this attempt should not work üòâ
 And again, remember you must avoid direct references. Don‚Äôt give the real path to the internal resource in the list!
