Migrating applications and data to AWS can feel like navigating a labyrinth, but its abundance of services simplifies the process by fitting your unique data migration needs, minimizing downtime and maximizing efficiency for seamless data movement. 

Here are some of the key AWS Migration and Data Transfer services, let this bird's-eye view guide you through your AWS migration journey

Simplify your cloud migration journey with AWS Migration Hub - central console to manage and track all your migrations, from discovering on-premises servers and databases with Application Discovery Service (ADS) to analyzing costs and potential savings with Migration Evaluator.

Choosing the right service depends on your specific needs and environment. For instance, if you want to migrate your databases with minimal downtime, AWS DMS is your go-to service.
Let's take a closer look at AWS DMS in this blog.

## What is AWS DMS? 
AWS DMS is a service that helps you migrate and replicate your databases, data warehouses, analytical workloads other data stores between on-premises, Amazon RDS, EC2 instances, different cloud providers and AWS. 

## Benefits
### Minimal downtime
The source database is fully operational during the migration. Changes made to the source during the migration are continuously replicated to the target database. 
DMS can perform parallel data loads, optimizing the migration speed and minimizing the overall downtime required for the migration process.
### Specific Database Needs
AWS DMS supports homogeneous migrations such as on-premises PostgreSQL to RDS PostgreSQL, and heterogeneous migrations between different database engines such as Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora using DMS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT). DMS Schema Conversion Tool can automatically convert your schema to ensure compatibility, saving you time and effort.
### Modernization and Scalability
Migrating to cloud-based managed services like Amazon Aurora offers increased scalability, automatic patching, and improved security compared to on-premises databases. AWS DMS simplifies this process by handling the data transfer and schema conversion. 
As your data needs grow, on-premises infrastructure can become limiting. AWS DMS allows you to seamlessly scale your database capacity by migrating to larger AWS instances or services like Redshift. 
### Flexibility and Agility
If you have multiple databases on-premises or across different cloud providers, AWS DMS can help you consolidate them into a single, centralized location in the AWS cloud, simplifying management and improving data access. 
### Disaster recovery and backup
You can perform one-time migrations or continuous data replication with CDC (Change Data Capture) to ensure near real-time backups and a seamless disaster recovery plan.
DMS provides automatic failover. If your primary replication server fails for any reason, a backup replication server can take over with little or no interruption of service. 
Data integrity validation throughout the process upholds data accuracy.
Choose Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and enhanced failover support.
### Cost Optimization
Maintaining on-premises databases can be expensive due to hardware, software licensing. Migrating with AWS DMS can reduce these costs. Only pay for resources used with pay-as-you-go pricing.
AWS DMS automates many of the tedious tasks involved in database migration, allowing your IT team to focus on other critical projects. 
### Logging and Monitoring
DMS offers detailed logs like task statuses, data transfer rates, and error messages. You can set up custom alerts for potential issues and monitor key metrics like replication lag and database performance.
### Security
With DMS your data is encrypted at rest with AWS KMS and in transit with SSL/TLS. Granular IAM access controls ensure only authorized users can access your data, while continuous anomaly and threat detection add an extra layer of protection.


## How to Create a DMS Migration Project: A High-Level View
1. Discover databases for migration
To discover your source data infrastructure, you can deploy AWS DMS Data Collectors' lightweight agents for in-depth analysis or use AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS) Agentless Collector for a quick overview. For detailed insights across multiple databases, choose AWS DMS Fleet Advisor. 
Supported [Sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Introduction.Sources.html#CHAP_Introduction.Sources.title) and supported [Targets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Introduction.Targets.html) for AWS DMS. 

2. Schema conversion
If migrating between different type of databases, use DMS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) to convert database schemas and code objects. 

3. Source and Target Endpoints
AWS DMS uses an endpoint to connect to your source or target data store. Create source and target endpoints by specifying type of database engine, server name or ip address, ports, SSL mode, credentials. Test endpoint connection in DMS console. A single endpoint can be used by multiple replication tasks. 

4. Replication instance 
Launch a replication instance by choosing instance class, configuring network and security settings. AWS DMS uses a replication instance to access your source data store. A single replication instance can handle multiple replication tasks simultaneously. You can also use AWS DMS Serverless which provides automatic provisioning, scaling, capacity estimation, built-in high availability. 
[Choosing the right AWS DMS replication instance for your migration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Types.html).

5. Replication task
When creating a replication task, choose the replication instance that will run the task, specify source and target database endpoints. Choose migration or replication mode: Full Load, Full Load + CDC, or only CDC (Change Data Capture) for continuous data replication to keep your source and target databases in sync. When migration is complete, the target database will remain synchronized with the source for as long as you choose, allowing you to cutover at a convenient time.

## Conclusion
AWS DMS empowers you to migrate and replicate databases with minimal downtime tailored to your unique needs. Modernize, scale, secure your data, all while saving costs and gaining greater flexibility.
