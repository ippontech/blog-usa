On June, 21st 2018 took place the first ever [JHipster Conf](https://jhipster-conf.github.io/)! With 200 attendees, international speakers, and nearly the whole [JHipster core dev team](https://www.jhipster.tech/team/) united for the first time ever, that was an impressive and very enjoyable event.

This post is a summary of that event, and will be updated as we gather more content (speakers slides, photos, videos...). Updates will be announced on [the conference Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jhipsterconf).
