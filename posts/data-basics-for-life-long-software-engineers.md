## Data Basics for Life-Long Software Engineers  
Having recently made the switch from Software Engineering to Data Engineering I’ve learned there are many new concepts and ideas that need to be picked up and understood quickly. Such concepts include things like Data Lakes, Data Warehouses and Data Modeling. In this blog post I’d like to give a basic introduction to each of these concepts from a very high level allowing those new to the data world (like me) a nice springboard into learning more about these topics.

### Data Lakes, Data Warehouses and The Process
Now from a very high level view a Data Lake can be considered a repository for raw, unreformed data whereas a Data Warehouse is a repository for processed, ready for production data. In the diagram below we can see that the Data Lake can receive data from a number of sources - in this case, databases - which will then be available for Data Engineers to study, analyze and manipulate (more on that in a bit).

<br><br>

Near the tail end of the process we see the Data Warehouse which houses data ready to be used by real world users, not just Data Engineers. As we can see, end users utilizing tools like Excel and Power BI can use this data in their work. But how do we get there? That’s where Data Modeling comes in.
<br><br>

### Data Modeling
At its most basic Data Modeling is the process we use to visualize and represent data that will be stored within our Data Warehouse. This will include studying and understanding the data we will be working with and discovering the relationships between this data all while working towards creating data models that will be useful to the end user. 
<br><br>
At this point we can use a simple example to better illustrate the concept. 
<br><br>
Suppose you’ve been tasked with analyzing school data with the end user wanting to run reports to see how students are doing with their assessments (among other things). One of the first steps would be to look at the available data and begin to understand what it represents and how it can be related to each other to help enrich it.
<br><br>
Within the database we find an Assessments table with seems to have some information that will be useful to the end user:

<br><br>

In looking at this data we notice there is a subject_id which appears to correlate with the id within the Subjects table:
<br><br>

<br><br>

It appears we found a useful relationship between these individual tables! This association can be seen below: 
<br><br>

<br><br>

Finding these relationships is at the heart of Data Modeling. What we have done is made the data more useful, valuable and meaningful to the end user who will be using this in their daily reporting. We can use this same methodology to continue to find meaningful relationships within the data to further enhance it but for the sake of simplicity we will leave our Data Modeling here. 
<br><br>

At the end of this process we now have a new table that we can call ready for production and will live in our Data Warehouse. 
<br><br>

<br><br>

### Conclusion
As mentioned before this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to each of these topics. Even so, as a long time Software Engineer that has only recently made the jump to Data Engineering and now has one completed data project under his belt, this is high-level information that would have been invaluable to have known going into it. I would imagine any other life-long Software Engineers thinking about making the switch into the world of data would probably agree.
