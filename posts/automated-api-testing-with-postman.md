Introduction:


# Create Test suites
Since our client is mainly using MongoDB, we chose to use JaVers.
JaVers is an audit log framework that helps to track changes of entities in the application.

The usage of this tool is not limited to debugging and auditing only. It can be successfully applied to perform analysis and force security policies.

# Jenkins integration



# Conclusion
As a complementary solution, the JaVers audit logs should be consolidated in real-time into a centralized log system to monitor and enable security alerts on top of the audit logs, and give read access to a third party auditor.
