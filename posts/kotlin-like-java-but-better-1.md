Kotlin has quickly risen to popularity as an alternative language to Java.
In this blog series, I will first provide a crash-course in Kotlin to
examine some of the design differences between Kotlin and Java, and then add
some Kotlin code to an existing Java Spring Boot microservice in part two.

# Kotlin 101
![Kotlin 101](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2021/05/kotlin-like-java-but-better-2.png)

Kotlin was introduced by JetBrains in 2011 as a new language for the JVM. It
was designed to be fully interoperable with Java, and in several cases, has 
replaced it. In 2019, Google announced that Kotlin was now the official 
language for Android development. Tools such as Spring Boot and 
[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) allow you to start from scratch with
Kotlin, but you can also seamlessly add Kotlin to an existing Java codebase!

# What Kotlin Does Differently
## Variable Declaration
There are two keywords to declare a variable: `var` and `val`. 

`var` is used to declare a variable that behaves just as you would expect an
ordinary Java variable to act. The type of the variable is declared after the
variable name, and declaring the type is optional if the variable is 
instantiated. 
```kotlin
var num = 12
var name: String
name = "Jane Doe"
```

`val` is used to declare variables as read-only, similar to declaring a 
variable final in Java. Attempting to change the reference of a val will result
in a compilation error.
```kotlin
val num = 12 
num = 13 //compilation error
```

You also may notice the lack of semicolons. Fear not -- I did not make a 
mistake! Semicolons are optional in Kotlin, and you shouldn't ever need them.
The compiler will infer your statement endings.

## Null Safety
One of the key design decisions that the Kotlin team made was to enforce 
[null safety](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html) at compile-time.
All variables must explicitly be declared as either nullable or non-nullable. 
```kotlin
var foo: Int? // nullable Int variable
var bar: Int // non-nullable Int

bar = Null // compilation error
```
As a result of this feature, NullPointerExceptions will never be thrown in 
pure Kotlin code unless you explicitly throw one. They won't be missed! Kotlin
also provides some additional syntax to enable working with these new null 
constraints. 

Inline null-checks can be used to access methods or fields of an object that
may or may not be null. If the object is null, then the expression is 
evaluated as `null`. If the object is not null, then the expression is 
evaluated as normal.
```kotlin
var name: String? = null
var length: Int? = name?.length()
// length is null

name = "Jane Doe"
length = name?.length()
// length is eight
```

My favorite null safety feature is the Elvis operator `?:`. This operator has 
earned such a prestigious name because if you tilt your head sideways, it kind
of looks like an emoticon of Elvis with his rock-star hair! It is the 
null-coalescing operator available in Kotlin and makes working with nullable
variables even eaiser. The Elvis operator allows for you to return an 
alternative value if a statement is null.
```kotlin
var name: String? = null
var length: Int // length is a non-nullable Int
length = name?.length() ?: 0 
// length is zero

name = "Jane Doe"
length = name?.length() ?: 0
// length is eight
```

## Data Classes
Kotlin provides the 
[data class](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html) syntax to make 
declaring POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) a one-line affair.
```kotlin
data class Person(var firstName: String, var lastName: String, var age: Int)
```
The data class syntax creates a new class with a default constructor, getters 
and setters, and commonly used methods such as equals(), toString(), 
hashCode(), and copy(). All of these defaults can be overridden if necessary,
but are completely fine for most use cases.

## Class Extensions
One of the coolest Kotlin features is the ability to extend existing classes by
defining new methods for that class outside of the class definition. These 
[extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html) are 
extremely useful when working with classes that are imported from a library or 
if you want to install some new logic onto a built-in class.

```kotlin
// MutableList is Kotlin's built-in version of ArrayList
fun MutableList<Int>.swap(index1: Int, index2: Int) {
    val tmp = this[index1]
    this[index1] = this[index2]
    this[index2] = tmp
}

val list = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
list.swap(0, 2) /// list is now [3, 2, 1]
```

## Coroutines

Kotlin has introduced a robust 
[coroutine](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) system to 
support asynchronous programming. Coroutines are lightweight virtual 
threads that all run on the main thread.  

```kotlin
fun main() {
    GlobalScope.launch { // launch a new coroutine in background and continue
        delay(1000L) // non-blocking delay for 1 second (default time unit is ms)
        println("World!") // print after delay
    }
    println("Hello,") // main thread continues while coroutine is delayed
    Thread.sleep(2000L) // block main thread for 2 seconds to keep JVM alive
}
```

An in-depth look at all of what coroutines have to offer would probably turn
this blog post into a short book, but they are one of the primary features 
that allow you to utilize more modern programming principles in your Kotlin 
code.

You may also notice that Kotlin has a println() method. This is another example
of the quality of life improvements that Kotlin provides to make the syntax 
eaiser- no more `System.out.println()`!

# How to Get Started
If you're ready to get started with Kotlin, there are tons of great resources 
to begin learning Kotlin.
- [Getting Started With Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview) - A set of 
exercises to introduce someone familiar with Java to Kotlin syntax and
patterns  
- [Spring Boot Kotlin Tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-kotlin/) - Get started creating a Spring Boot project completely in Kotlin.

JetBrains describes Kotlin as, "a modern but already mature programming
language aimed to make developers happier," and I completely agree with this
assessment. As someone with a Java background, Kotlin provides me with
a similar coding experience to Java, but with changes that consistently
improve the development experience and allow me to focus on problem solving
instead.

Spend an hour or two going through the Kotlin Koans, and I guarantee you will 
begin to notice these small differences. Once you're ready to begin working
with Kotlin, you can write projects from scratch in Kotlin, or utilize Kotlin's
deep interoperability with Java. As long as you're working with Java 6 or 
newer, it's as simple as adding the Kotlin compiler to your project and 
beginning to write Kotlin classes. 

Part of two of this blog will walk through converting an existing Spring Boot
application from Java to Kotlin. Stay tuned!
