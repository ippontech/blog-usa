Snowflake Summit is the world's largest data, apps, and AI conference. Coming to you live from Las Vegas, Nevada, from June 26 - 29, 2023, Snowflake shows off all of the latest advancements coming to the Snowflake Data Cloud - including generative AI and LLMs, Apache Iceberg, application development, and more. I'm not in sunny, hot Las Vegas, but wanted to highlight some of the improvements Snowflake announced and educate all of you on the cool stuff (cause ***Snowflake***, get it?) coming our way.

# Snowflake Summit 2023 Replay - Snowpark Container Development

Phew! It definitely feels like I've been drinking from a firehose this week! 

There have been so many new advancements during the 2023 Snowflake Summit. Snowpark for Container Development is one of the most interesting features they've announced. We've all seen containerized services before. If you're anything like me, a common pain point is the latency you see when bringing data from your data warehouse or lake into your application for processing or analysis. This is one of the problems Snowflake is addressing by expanding Snowpark. With Snowpark Container Services, you can run full-stack applications end-to-end, from the data layer all the way to the UI, all on Snowflake with containerized compute support.

Snowpark Container Services is built on a Kubernetes-based infrastructure which allows containers to be deployed to the Snowflake Platform, where the containerized application can be managed and orchestrated. This allows users to run a variety of workloads more securely within Snowflake. Snowpark already natively supports SQL, JavaScript, Java, Scala, and Python, but with the introduction of Snowpark Container Services, developers have the flexibility to build data-driven applications in any language they'd like, not just the natively supported ones. Developers will also be able to package, distribute, and perhaps even monetize the applications they build by publishing their applications on the Snowflake Marketplace.

Snowpark Container Services were just announced this week, and I can't wait to see what the new use cases and developments come with this expansion to Snowpark.
