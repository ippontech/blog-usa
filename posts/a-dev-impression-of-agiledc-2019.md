## The Question

"What is a developer hoping to get out of an agile conference?" While networking at the 10th annual AgileDC conference, I received this question a few times because I was in the minority there as a developer. To be fair, I had the same thought when I was registering. And well, since the people asked, I thought it might be insightful to share the dev impression of an agile conference in the year 2019.

## A Dev in The Aircraft Journey

Let us start off by envisioning we are on a team which has decided to set out on a journey with a single destination in mind. If we are taking a small plane, there is a lot we need to do as a team to get from point A to B. Our aircraft's instruments are critical for giving us real time measurements. But there are still calculations that need to be performed when it comes to fuel, distance, speed, etc. in order to arrive at our destination safely.

Depending on your role in the agile process, the starting point for and involvement in this journey can be quite different. While a Product Owner role is involved in the initial resource planning and throughout to provide a clear roadmap of the path, a Developer role will be relied upon for their skilled and focused work on critical calculations. Their work's limited scope and Scrum Master prevent distractions making it possible to even jump between various objectives.

During this impressive journey, a developer can easily get caught up in the instrument minutia. From time to time, it is necessary to hit autopilot and remember where our various roles fit in the grander picture. This was my rationale for attending the conference as a developer.

## Our Drivers Wear Many Hats

The majority of individuals I spoke with tended to be Program/Project Managers, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, Business Analyst or a conglomeration of any aforementioned. It was interesting that they typically "wore multiple hats" of these agile roles since each one of these should be a different person in the traditional sense. Through the past experiences of my various consulting projects though, I was not surprised these individuals were assigned to multiple functions. I was quietly skeptical on how they kept each one's intentions separated. As a developer, I have shared some of the responsibilities of scrum master or coached on certain agile approaches. But something about the multiple, shared PM/PO/SM seemed next level to me.

## The Hot Take The Wheel

What did the AgileDC conference lack the most? Might I dare to say: More developers! As I learned from one of the talks, most people are not aware agile actually originated from developers. And what it says most to me is that more developers need to take control of the agile process they are already a part of or that is needed on their projects. Most of us have sat in the backseat and let the process lead whereas it should be the other way around.
