## The Question

"What is a developer hoping to get out of an agile conference?" While networking at the 10th annual AgileDC conference, I received this question a few times because I was in the minority there as a developer. To be fair, I had the same thought when I was registering. And well, since the people asked, I thought it might be insightful to share the dev impression of an agile conference in the year 2019.

## Initial Observations

The majority of individuals I spoke to tended to be Program/Project Managers, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, or a conglomeration of all four.
