## The Question

"What is a developer hoping to get out of an agile conference?" While networking at the [10th annual AgileDC conference](https://www.agiledc.org), I received this question a few times because I was in the minority there as a developer. To be fair, I had the same thought when I was registering. And well, since the people asked, I thought it might be insightful to share the dev impression of an agile conference in the year 2019.

## A Dev in The Aircraft Journey

Let us start off by envisioning we are on a team which has decided to set out on a journey with a single destination in mind. If we are taking a small plane, there is a lot we need to do as a team to get from point A to B. Our aircraft's instruments are critical for giving us real time measurements. But there are still calculations that need to be performed when it comes to fuel, distance, speed, etc. in order to arrive at our destination safely.

Depending on your role in the agile process, the starting point for and involvement in this journey can be quite different. While a Product Owner role is involved in the initial resource planning and throughout to provide a clear roadmap of the path, a Developer role will be relied upon for their skilled and focused work on critical calculations. Their work's limited scope and Scrum Master prevent distractions making it possible to even jump between various objectives.

During this impressive journey, a developer can easily get caught up in the instrument minutia. From time to time, it is necessary to hit autopilot and remember where our various roles fit in the grander picture. This was my rationale for attending the conference as a developer.

## In-Flight Communications

## Turbulence Detected

The [second talk](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/MAe6cHpszkj2h9) I attended attributed shortened cycle time to a technique the team used called the "Andon Cord". This is a Toyota innovation designed to empower front-line employees to recognize issues, initiate a stoppage of work, and work together as a team to quickly identify a path forward. The emergency cable strung above assembly lines became a symbol of the Toyota Way, and has widely been copied throughout the auto industry and beyond. The presenter's team replicated by using a Slack "@here" to force halt the team's multi-streamed work so they could together be effective on a single objective. I've talked previously about the benefits of [mob programming](https://blog.ippon.tech/mobs-are-not-always-destructive/) to collaborate on a single solution so this concept definitely spoke positively to me.

## No Smoking Allowed

Whenever we fly we observe a shared agreement to not smoke while we are onboard. The third session I attended layed out how to develop these [Social Contracts](https://speakerdeck.com/elipbig/agiledc-team-culture-and-social-contracts) to drive culture on our teams. As I have participated in meetings establishing norms several times over my consulting career, the power of this presentation lay in when it is appropriate to **revisit** these social contracts.

For example, most individuals these days no longer smoke cigarettes. Does this invalidate the "no smoking" norm? Smoking is still prohibited due to safety reasons and could cause major problems if a fire actually did break out onboard the plane. Something this critical should be understood by everyone. Not only this, but the popular rise in e-cigarettes would suggest as well this constant reminder is still relevant.

## Observing the Signs

Of course whenever we fly, there is also always that person who ignores the illuminated fasten-seatbelt sign. Immediately, I am left with questions around their intentions. What I learned in the next workshop on aspects for [observing a retrospective](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/dmxdQ8ddtjJguC?feature=oembed)is that observation is key, but try not to assume anything right away. Analyzing and jumping to conclusions is a powerful ability developers often do very well. But when it is with regards to another human being, we tend to overlook some important factors: body language, tone of voice, what pronouns are said, how physical space is utilized, collaboration styles, decision making, and the way information is shared.

Retrospectives are one of the ceremonies which can require a ton of empathy. I realized through this exercise that better observing, without judgment, led to asking non-biased questions about these indicators. This action is crucial to the formation of bonds with each other and as a team.

## Quality Keeps Us Airborne

Speaking of biases, one of my favorite talks of the day was presented by Ippon's own, Ben Scott, on [cultivating Software Craftsmanship](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/ranGHnIPlrMDDI?feature=oembed).

## Tracking Journey Metrics

## Cloudy Priorities

## The Hot Take The Wheel

What did the AgileDC conference lack the most? Might I dare to say: More developers! As I learned, most people are not aware agile actually originated from developers. What this says most to me is that more developers need to take control of the agile process they are already a part of or that is needed on their projects. Even non-developers, most of us have taken a backseat as a passenger on the agile aircraft and let the process steer whereas it should be the other way around.
