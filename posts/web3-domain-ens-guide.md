## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. This platform allows you to deploy distributed unstoppable applications that run on top of the blockchain network.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

The [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains/) is an open source decentralized internet naming protocol that runs as a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to the Domain Name System (DNS), ENS translates computer identifiers into human-readable names with a dot-separated right-to-left hierarchical naming structure.

The native suffix of ENS is .eth but does support other Top Level Domains (TLDs) like .luxe, .abc, and .xyz with DNSSEC integration implementation.

## Creating an Ethereum Wallet

Ethereum wallets are applications that let you interact with your Ethereum account. Think of it like an internet banking app – without the bank. Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications. You will need a wallet and some ethereum to register an ENS domain. You can create a metamask or coinbase wallet for free. In this guide I will mostly focus on using the metamask wallet, but setting up another wallet should be very similar.

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

Install the MetaMask browser extension from their website -> [MetaMask (https://metamask.io/)](https://metamask.io/)

Follow the instructions and make sure to save your secret seed phrase somewhere that you will be able to retrieve it later on. If you lose this you might not be able to access your wallet and lose your crypto holdings.

Once the wallet is setup, you can attach the wallet to the ENS app using the browser extension.

## Linking the Wallet to ENS
