## Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Îž) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. This platform allows you to deploy distributed unstoppable applications that run on top of the blockchain network.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is an open source decentralized internet naming protocol that runs as a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to the Domain Name System (DNS), ENS translates computer identifiers into human-readable names with a dot-separated right-to-left hierarchical naming structure.

The native suffix of ENS is .eth but does support other Top Level Domains (TLDs) like .luxe, .abc, and .xyz with DNSSEC integration implementation.
