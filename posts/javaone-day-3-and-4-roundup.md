Presented by:

Josh Long([@starbuxman](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)) – Spring evangelist
 Phil Webb([@phillip_webb](https://twitter.com/starbuxman)) – Co-lead Spring Boot

#### jHipster

We got a nice name drop for jHipster from Josh Long during the presentation. jHipster helps you stand up a web app with Angular JS and Twitter Bootstrap on the front end with a Spring Boot REST API backend.

###

### Use new technologies

One thing Josh Long stressed is that people “make do” with outdated technologies unnecessarily.  Developers should always be researching and investigating new technologies and new versions of existing tools.  Spring is constantly releasing new versions of their frameworks and modules with lots of great features.     He illustrated this point with the following image:

This is fine – Not adapting to and utilizing new technologies

### Returns observable

Spring offers asynchronous request processing flow support to return the result back to the user when available from the CompletableFuture, so as to not hold up the containers thread. You can make REST calls using CompletableFuture asynchronously in a non-blocking manner.

### CDI threatens spring?

CDI and Spring are not competing technologies.  Spring is a ecosystem built around a dependency injection container and CDI is context and dependency injection.

CDI and Spring are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

### Spring Data

There have been lots of great advanced with the Spring Data project and you should check it out. [http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/)

Pivotal

Pivotal was hosting great hands-on workshops on using various Spring technologies.  Maybe next year they will use jHipster to help stand up starter projects to demo features of Spring!

They had tons of swag but it was going fast.  Do you see the jHipster stickers on the corner of the podium?   Big thanks to Pivotal for helping us hand out jHipster swag!
