Following [Kate’s article](https://blog.ippon.tech/vagrant-and-ansible-for-new-developer-on-boarding/) about Vagrant, I would like to introduce a new piece of software that has proven useful: [Vagrant Manager](http://vagrantmanager.com/)!

Developed by Lanayo Technologies, this tool provides a well-thought-out user interface for Windows and MacOS to manage all the vagrant machines on your computer (hopefully a Linux version will be developed too). A menu which you can open via your OS toolbar allows you to:

- See all the configured VMs on your computer with their respective statuses
- Bookmark your favorite VMs
- Execute vagrant commands: run, halt, provide, SSH…

Let’s get [productive](http://vagrantmanager.com/downloads/)!
