Fresh off the high of my successes in [Part 1](http://blog.ippon.tech/setup-dev-environment/), where I successfully set up my development environment, I got ready to create an application using the freshly downloaded JHipster. I am psyched!

![excited stressed cat as dramatic reenactment of being psyched](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2017/10/excited_cat_stressed.jpg)
*Dramatic reenactment.*

But... I’m also kind of nervous, because I’ve never done anything like this before. Also, I decided to take a leap of faith that I can follow the instructions OK, and I haven’t even talked with my buddy Jake, like I did for part 1.

That’s OK, I’m sure it’ll be fine. [Here are the instructions](http://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/), in case you want to follow along.

All right, enough stalling. Here goes...

# Step 1:  Create an empty directory and go to it

* For this step, I simply opened Terminal and typed in the command `mkdir myapplication`
* Then I went to that directory by inputting the following command:
`cd myapplication`

Success! I could tell that I had input the command successfully, because my command line in Terminal changed to have `:myapplication` in it.

# Step 2: Generate my application

To generate my application, I input the following command: `jhipster`

Success! This was pretty cool, because I got the following returned in Terminal.

# Step 3: Answer questions about the application I want to create

* May JHipster anonymously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time? (Y/n) → I said Y
* Which type of application would you like to create? The options are Monolithic, Microservice, Microservice gateway, JHipster UAA server.
* I opted to create Monolithic application because I wanted to just create something simple; also, it is the recommended default if you don’t have another preference (which, in this case, I do not).
* What is the base name of your application? This one was a little confusing to me at first because it looked like this:

![base name of application question was confusing at first - picture of question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2017/10/base_application_name_question.png)

It turned out that this meant that the base name was defaulted to `myapplication`; I had the option to rename it if I wanted to, but I didn’t have to. Also, the application was going to run from my own server or computer so I could call it whatever I wanted to, at least for now. For right now, I opted to leave it called `myapplication`.

* What is your default Java package name? I left this as the default and hit Enter.
* Do you want to use the JHipster Registry to configure, monitor and scale your application? I said No, because I am not doing Microservices and because I’m only building an application for fun.
* Which type of authentication would you like to use? I said JWT, because it’s the default and that seemed fine.
* Which type of database would you like to use? I chose SQL, because it’s the default and I don’t think I’m going to use a database anyway.
* Which production database would you like to use? I left it as MySQL, the default.
* Which development database would you like to use? I left it as H2, the default.
* Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache? I kept the default answer here (Yes, with ehcache)
* Would you like to use Maven or Gradle for building the backend? Maven (the default answer)
* Which other technologies would you like to use? I left this as the default, which means none are selected.
* Which framework would you like to use? I left this as Angular 4 (the default)
* Would you like to use the LibSass stylesheet preprocessor for your CSS? N (selected because it appears to be the default, and because the instructions suggest using Node-sass instead; also, I do not have plans to work with CSS right now)
* Would you like to enable internationalization support? Y (selected because it appears to be the default)
* Please choose the native language of the application: English
* Besides JUnit and Karma, which testing frameworks would you like to use? I selected Cucumber
* Would you like to install other generators from the JHipster Marketplace? N (selected because I don’t want anything else right now)

The scripts to run this took a few minutes after I hit Enter the last time. Also, I noticed that answering all of these questions was somewhat tedious and took a long time, compared to the previous whirl of setup. I felt my energy starting to flag.

But just then...

Wait for it...

Success! I got a “Build successful” message from JHipster!

*I’m en fuego.*

I’ve totally earned a coffee break.

# Step 4: Run Spring Boot application

My next steps are outlined near the end of the successful build - see the green highlighted text in the screenshot. I need to:

* Run Spring Boot application

I do this by pasting the yellow-green text in at the Terminal prompt.

# Step 5: Visit my new application

Spring is running successfully, and I see a message in Terminal saying that my application “myapplication” is running. The message looks like this (highlighting is mine).

![confirmation that application is running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2017/10/new-application-is-running.png)

Included is a URL I can visit (locally, because I haven’t yet deployed this to production or anywhere) to see the application running! Naturally, I do this immediately, pasting the local URL into my web browser of choice.

And... ta-da! There it is... my very own JHipster application, running locally on my very own browser.

![welcome screen for new JHipster application running locally](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2017/10/my_application_1.png)

I feel absurdly proud.

![regal looking cat gazing into distance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ippontech/blog-usa/master/images/2017/10/proud_cat.jpg)

I can log in as an admin, or as a user, thanks to the authentication that has been installed as part of the application. Very cool.

# So, what have I accomplished?

My application is running locally. This is a great first step, and it’s great if I need to do more tweaking and development work on it. However, this also means it will only run when I tell it to run. After I shut down Terminal, it will no longer be running. And then, to run it again, I’ll need to do the following:

* Open up Terminal and input the following command: `cd myapplication/`
* Re-start JHipster by inputting the command `./mvnw`
* Then I can see the same URL that I saw before, which will allow me to access this locally in a web browser. So easy! I can keep doing this all day long if I want (but it gets boring - trust me).

# Possible Next Steps

Thinking beyond local access, after I get my application stable enough, I might want to deploy it to a server, which might be running more frequently or for longer durations. Or, in a production situation, the JHipster app would probably run on a server that would be up 24/7, so it would essentially be running all the time.

So a potential next step, if I continue down this path, would be to deploy my application somewhere, to a hosted environment. Since I don’t have anything like that up at the moment, I’m going to put this on hold for the time being.

# Your Turn

So, what do you think? Are you ready to try this yourself? Please do - and reach out to me with any questions at all, because I'd love to hear from you - and help, if I can.
