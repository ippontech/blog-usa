title: "Mobs Are Not Always Destructive"

This past week I took place in a software development strategy that I had never heard of before:  Mob Programming. I am sure many might envision situations as I did of an angry group of engineers pitching comments and improvements on my code with a multitude of GitHub Pull Requests from their forked repositories. Good news, it was nothing like this pitch-forked scenario. Instead of it being a destructive or distributed activity, my experience with mobbing was quite the opposite.

# One Goal

Mob programming has only one purpose:  to deliver a single piece of work. Prior to the mobbing time, a goal is selected for the exercise which may push the team in the right direction and utilized further on down the line. So in this way it can be interpreted as a story, task, or whatever deemed as an integral step. This step will be as complex or simple as necessary because it depends on what the participating group is capable of completing.

# One Collective Team - All for one, and One for All

This inclusivity is the mentality of mobbing. And as is such, rules to help enforce that are as follows:

1. Everyone focused on the goal (if you have to do something else step out)
1. One person coding at a time
1. Person coding switches every 15 minutes
1. Problem solve as a group
1. Person on the keyboard does not type anything they don't understand

These rules allow for each member of the team to participate. The whole group is centered around a single goal and only one person is driving at a time. One way to think of mobbing is as a larger version of [paired programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/). Additionally, not mentioned above, the individual on the keyboard is not "thinking" while he/she is driving so that the group collectively agrees on an idea before it is implemented.

# Our Mob

For our time, the primary objective was to: "Implement First A/B Test". Our A/B Test would be to provide all users with either Experience A or Experience B in the application. With a fifty-fifty split between showing A or B, our team was to implement functionality where each user will be shown educational content in different locations on the page.
